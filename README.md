# Rad's Awesome DragonRuby Game Toolkit Starter Kit (RAD Starter Kit)

[DragonRuby Game Toolkit](https://dragonruby.itch.io/) is an already awesome toolkit.

However, I find that some key classes - for a more OOP-ish game development experience - are missing.
This starter kit is a collection of classes and practices that I have developed along the way.

Disclaimer: I'm still learning DragonRuby Toolkit, and I have yet to publish a single game with it.
