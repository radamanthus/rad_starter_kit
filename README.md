# Rad's Awesome DragonRuby Game Toolkit Starter Kit (RAD Starter Kit)

[DragonRuby Game Toolkit](https://dragonruby.itch.io/) is an already awesome toolkit.

However, I find that some key classes - for a more OOP-ish game development experience - are missing.
This starter kit is a collection of classes and practices that I have developed along the way.

*Disclaimer: I'm still learning DragonRuby Toolkit, and I have yet to publish a single game with it.*

## Getting Started

[Download](https://github.com/radamanthus/rad_starter_kit/archive/master.zip), unzip, then rename the directory to your game project's name.

You now have an empty project with three buttons: 

- New Game
- Help
- About

Clicking the button displays an empty screen and passes the control to it. Clicking anywhere on the screen returns back to the main menu.

Modify the appropriate screen file to implement your game: 

- Game screen: `app/game_screen.rb`
- Help screen: `app/help_screen.rb`
- About screen: `app/about_screen.rb`
